# hello-world

My name is Tunji. Once upon a time (16 yrs ago to be precise), I attempted going into the IT field. I spent a good year acquiring skills to be certified to handle hardware, software, and networking problems. It's amazing how much has changed since I left the field in 2002. 
I feel, once again, like a complete novice as I begin this Data science course. Am I in good company here? Perhaps so. This is what I love about this age. At our finger tips, we now have all the resources we need to learn about anything we desire.

If you made it this far reading my note, my apologies, my future notes will hopefully be more helpful to you :). Good luck!
